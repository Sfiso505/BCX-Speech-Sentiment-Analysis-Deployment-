Create a Detailed Project Portfolio:

Document your project thoroughly, including the problem statement, objectives, data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
Explain the significance of your project and how it addresses real-world challenges or applications.



Explain the Impact:

Discuss the potential real-world impact of your project. For example, how could your sentiment analysis model be applied in various industries or scenarios?



Continuous Learning:

Emphasize your commitment to continuous learning. Mention any further steps you plan to take to enhance your skills in data science and related fields.


Backend Integration:

Develop the backend logic to handle user inputs, process them, and send them to the model for inference. The backend will receive the model's output and send it back to the front-end for display.


Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to use your web interface. Include instructions for users, details about the model's input requirements, and any other relevant information.
\

Preprocessing Input:

When a user uploads an audio file through the web interface, you need to preprocess this audio data before feeding it to the model. This might involve extracting features from the audio file.
